## What is a toric variety?

There are a few equivalent characterizations of a toric variety. Here is one.

A toric variety is an algebraic variety $V$ which contains an algebraic torus $T$ as a dense open subset and the torus action on $T$ extends to $V$.

In any case, it is an algebaric variety. An algebraic variety is a set of common zeros of algebraic equations. An algebraic equation is an equations involving only polynomials. 

Polynomials are algebraic objects and points (common zeros) are geometric objects. 
Roughly, we study the geometry defined by polynomials. 
Algebaric geometry is a deep and interesting topic. 
It is beyond the scope of this course and the instructor. 
However, here is a glimse of the subject.

In the next few weeks we will see how combinatorial objects give rise to algebaric varieties.
